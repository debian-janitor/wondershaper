wondershaper (1.1a-4.1) unstable; urgency=low

  The wondershaper command has been relocated from /usr/sbin to /sbin,
  in order to comply with Debian Policy. Please update any scripts you 
  might have pointing to the old location.
  Policy considerations:
  As a boot time network interface command, it belongs in the same 
  place as /sbin/tc, iptables, etc.
  From a dependency standpoint, its intended to be run from 
  /etc/network/interfaces at boot time, so cannot be in a directory
  that is theoretically NFS mountable.
