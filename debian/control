Description: Easy to use traffic shaping script
 An easy to use traffic shaping script that provides these improvements:
  * Low latency for interactive traffic (and pings) at all times
  * Allow websurfing at reasonable speeds while uploading / downloading
  * Make sure uploads don't hurt downloads
  * Make sure downloads don't hurt uploads
 .
 It does this by:
  * Limiting upload speed slightly, to eliminate queues
  * Limiting download speed, while allowing bursts, to eliminate queues
  * Interactive traffic skips the queue
  * ACKs and tiny packets skip the queue
 .
 Configuring the wondershaper requires you to accurately and precisely 
 determine your consistent upload and download speeds.
 .
 The wondershaper is the simplest, easiest to use, entry level, traffic
 shaping script provided by Debian.
 .
 After installing this package, read highly the detailed instructions:
