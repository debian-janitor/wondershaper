TODO list

1) Three wishlist bugs to modify the config system
My original plan was a vaguely worded goal to "move configuration away from the
script itself".  Here are some more details.
The three wishlist bugs are:
235385 which contains some sample code for command line options which are more
"unix-like"
253554 requests I use the /etc/default system to contain "defaults" for various
internal functions.
253790 requests I use the HTB instead of the CBQ. That should be a configurable
option.
What I plan to do is combine all three bugs into one coherent plan that balances
the trend of adding complications and features with the goal of making the
wondershaper a very basic entry level simple to config system.
What I want is something that can be run completely off the command line
but can also support config files in /etc/default, while supporting the 
additional configurable options that have been requested.
Finally, when I determine a new config method I need to have some way to support
current users with a backwards compatible config method.

2) Research the HTB vs CBQ in the following areas:
Compare benchmark tests and subjective tests of HTB and CBQ
Compare kernel compatibility of HTB and CBQ and produce some kind of statement
or table explaining which kernel versions support each queue and which Debian
kernel packages support each queue.
Given research, decide if and how to integrate HTB support into the wondershaper.
I need to do more research before determining if this whole HTB CBQ issue 
might be "too complicated" for a simple entry level script like the 
wondershaper.
